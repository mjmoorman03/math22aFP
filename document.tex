\section{What is Group Theory?}

In order to connect the ideas of group theory to the real world, we must first understand what a group is 
in relation to linear algebra. A group is a set of elements that are closed under a binary operation,
similarly to how vector spaces are closed under addition and scalar multiplication, but with the 
generalization that groups need not be composed of only vectors, but any set of elements.

\paragraph*{Definition 1:} A \textbf{group} is a set $S$ with a binary\footnote[1]{\textbf{Binary} refers to the number of elements that the operation requires to be defined, specifically 2. Consider the binary operation of multiplication. The expression $5*$ does not make sense without a second input, making multiplication of real numbers a binary operation. }
operation $\cdot$ 
such that the following axioms hold:
% axioms of a group
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Closure: For all $a,b \in S$, $a \cdot b \in S$.
    \item Associativity: For all $a,b,c \in S$, $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$.
    \item Identity: There exists a unique element $e \in S$ such that for all $a \in S$, $a \cdot e = e \cdot a = a$.
    \item Inverse: For all $a \in S$, there exists a unique element $a^{-1} \in S$ such that $a \cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \cdot a = e$.
\end{enumerate}
Formally, the set $S$ is known as the \textbf{underlying set} of the group, and 
the binary operation $\cdot$ is known as the \textbf{group operation}. Frequently,
a group $G$ is denoted by $G = \langle S, \cdot \rangle$. Additionally, abuses 
of notation are common, such that $G$ referring to a group can be used to refer 
to the group itself or the underlying set, such that a statement like '$a\in G$'
is meant to convey that $a$ is an element in the underlying set of the group $G$.

Additionally, another special type of group we will see is an \textbf{abelian group}.

\textbf{Definition 2:} An \textbf{abelian group} is a group $\langle V, \cdot \rangle$
such that for all $u,v \in V$, $u\cdot v = v\cdot u$. This means that our group operation 
is commutative, and the order in which we add elements does not matter.

\paragraph*{Example:}
This may seem confusing, but let's make it more concrete with an example: 
the real numbers together with the operation of addition as we know it. This 
group would be written $G = \langle \R, +\rangle$. Let's verify our axioms 
to truly grasp what they mean through this example:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Closure: Let $x,y\in\R$. Because the sum of any two real numbers 
    is defined as a real number, it must be the case that $x+y\in\R$. 
    \item Associativity: Let $x,y,z\in\R$. Because addition of real numbers 
    does not depend on the way in which terms are associated, it is the case 
    that $(x+y)+z = x+y+z$ and that $x+(y+z)=x+y+z$. Thus, $(x+y)+z=x+(y+z)$. 
    \item Identity: Let $e = 0$. $0\in\R$, and the addition of 0 to any $x\in\R$
    is equal to $x$ itself. Thus, for all $x\in\R$, $e+x=x+e=x$. 
    \item Inverse: For all $x\in\R$, allow $x^{-1}$, the inverse of $x$, to be equal 
    to $-x$, the negation of $x$. Thus, $-x+x=0$ via simple addition, and $e=0$.
    Therefore, for any choice of $x\in\R$, there exists an inverse element $x^{-1}$ in $\R$
    such that $x+ x^{-1} =e$, the identity element. 
\end{enumerate}
That's all! We have proven that the real numbers, along with the operation of 
addition as we know it, form a group! Now that we're a bit more comfortable with 
what a group is, what does it have to do with linear algebra? Or even anything 
else at all?

\section{Vector Spaces and their Connections to Groups}

In class, we defined a vector space as a non-empty set $V$ on which two operations,
scalar multiplication and vector addition, are defined subject to the following axioms,
where $u,v,w \in V$ and $c,d \in \R$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $u+v \in V$
    \item $u+v = v+u$
    \item $(u+v)+w = u+(v+w)$
    \item there exists a vector $0_v \in V$ such that $u+0_v = u$
    \item there exists a vector $-u \in V$ such that $u+(-u) = 0_v$
    \item $cu\in V$
    \item $c(u+v) = cu+cv$
    \item $(c+d)u = cu+du$
    \item $c(du) = (cd)u$
    \item $1 \cdot u = u$
\end{enumerate}
This is absolutely a correct definition, but we can introduce some additional 
notation as well as generalize $\R$. We will say that a vector space is a tuple 
$\langle V, K, +, \cdot \rangle$, where $V$ is a non-empty set, $K$ is a field\footnote[2]{A \textbf{field} refers to a set on which addition, multiplication, subtraction, etc. are defined as we know them to work for the real numbers. This is not incredibly important here, but it is relevant to note that the field $K$ is not necessarily the real numbers.},
$+$ is our vector addition operator, and $\cdot$ is our scalar multiplication operator,
and all of the previous axioms hold.

As we have seen, a group is a set of elements closed under a binary operation, which 
seems like a less restrictive version of a vector space, especially after having 
established this notation. It turns out that this is indeed the case, and that 
given our vector field $\langle V, K, +, \cdot \rangle$, we can always define 
an abelian group as simply $\langle V, + \rangle$.

\begin{mdframed}[roundcorner=10pt, backgroundcolor=gray!10]
  \textbf{Theorem 1:} Let $\langle V, K, +, \cdot \rangle$ be a vector space. Then,
  $\langle V, + \rangle$ is an abelian group.
\end{mdframed}

\begin{proof}
    In order to prove this theorem, we will verify all of the axioms of a group
    given that $V$ is a non-empty set of a vector space, and $+$ is the vector 
    addition operator from that same vector space. 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Closure: Let $u,v \in V$. Because axiom 1 of a vector space states that
      $u+v \in V$ and we are using the same set $V$ from our vector space and the 
      same binary operator, this property holds for our group as well.
      \item Associativity: Let $u,v,w \in V$. Because axiom 3 of a vector space states that
      $(u+v)+w = u+(v+w)$ and we are using the same set $V$ from our vector space and the
      same binary operator, this property holds for our group as well.
      \item Identity: Let $u$ be an arbitrary element of $V$. Because axiom 4 of a vector space states that
      there exists a vector $0_v \in V$ such that $u+0_v = u$ and we are using the same set $V$ from our vector space and the
      same binary operator, this property holds for our group as well using the 
      same identity element $0_v$ that we use for our vector space.
      \item Inverse: Let $u$ be an arbitrary element of $V$. Because axiom 5 of a vector space states that
      there exists a vector $-u \in V$ such that $u+(-u) = 0_v$ and we are using the same set $V$ from our vector space and the
      same binary operator, this property holds for our group as well.
    \end{enumerate}
Additionally, this is also an abelian group, which requires that our group operation 
is commutative. We know that this is the case because axiom 2 of a vector space states that
$u+v = v+u$ for all $u,v \in V$, where $V$ is our underlying set and $+$ is our group operator.
Because we have shown that each of our axioms for a group holds given a non-empty 
set $V$ from a vector space and the vector addition operator $+$ from that same
vector space, and that our group operation is commutative, we have proven that
$\langle V, + \rangle$ is an abelian group formed from any arbitrary vector space 
$\langle V, K, +, \cdot \rangle$.
\done  
\end{proof}

\paragraph*{} So, there is an interesting connection between groups and vector spaces,
but the similarities and connections do not stop there. We turn to examine 
\textbf{group homomorphisms}, and their similarities to linear transformations.
% do I want some sort of basic introduction here?

\section{Group Homomorphisms} 

A \textbf{group homomorphism} is a function $f:G\rightarrow H$ from a group 
$\langle G, \cdot\rangle$ to a group $\langle H, *\rangle$ such that 
$f$ preserves the group structure of $G$ and $H$. That is, $f$ must satisfy the following
property:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $f(g\cdot h) = f(g) * f(h)$
\end{enumerate}
where $g,h\in G$.
From this property, it can be deduced that $f(e_G) = e_H$, where $e_G$ is the
identity element of $G$ and $e_H$ is the identity element of $H$, and that 
$f(g^{-1}) = (f(g))^{-1}$. We leave these proofs as an exercise to the reader.
% or should we prove them here?



\section{Subgroups}

\section{Group actions}
\paragraph*{} We have seen how vector spaces can satisfy the group axioms, so a 
natural area of inquiry might be to dig further into the connection between these
 objects. For example, instead of investigating questions about groups directly, 
 might we instead be able to study some equivalent vector space / linear algebraic 
 object and then leverage the tools that we have been studying this semester to
answer our original question. As it turns out this is indeed possible. For the 
purposes of this paper (and simplicity) feel free to assume the relevant objects 
are finite linear groups. 
\paragraph*{} To find the explicit connection we will first introduce the notion
 of Group Actions in the context of vector spaces. Suppose a real vector space V,
  and a set of n x n invertible matrices in that space. Notice that this set of
  transformations satisfies the group axioms under matrix multiplication. We have
 an identity element in $I_n$, by the definition of invertibility each element
  has an inverse, and we have shown in class that invertible matrices can be 
  composed associatively to produce another invertible matrix. This is also known 
  as the general linear group of V (GL(V)). A group action maps elements of a 
  group to these transformations.  
\paragraph*{} We will get to the formal definition, but first some notes for
intuition. Notice how the underlying vector space is essentially unchanged after 
these transformations? While the coordinates of where points were mapped may be 
different from the original, the underlying space “looks” identical as did in 
the start. So these transformations acted on the space, but didn't change how it 
“looked”. In other words, these transformations are symmetry preserving operations. 
\paragraph*{} This idea is important, so I'll a give a more concrete example. 
Suppose a square, if you were to rotate that square by 90 degrees it would look 
exactly the same. Its vertices may be in different locations, but they were mapped 
to each other in a such a way that the structure we care about preserving 
(square-ness) is kept intact. Also notice that there are many different symmetries 
that one could exploit to perform a symmetric action. Because of the nature of 
a “symmetric operation”, whenever one considers the set of symmetric operations 
on an object, there is an identity element, an inverse, and composition 
(the underlying structure always looks the same so composing symmetric operations 
will also produce the same structure, so the net result must also conform to some 
other symmetric operation). 
\paragraph*{} Cayleys theorem tells us that every group is isomorphic to a 
subgroup of a symmetric group., though not a very interesting one \\
\textbf{Proof:}
\paragraph*{} The upshot is this: Groups have a deep connection to symmetry, 
and Group Actions map groups to symmetry groups (the set of automorphisms) of 
mathematical objects. When we can perform group actions on a vector space V we 
can often map group elements to subgroups of GL(V), allowing us to use linear 
algebra.
